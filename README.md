## Introduction.
This repository contains example notebooks and tutorials showing how to access the Copernicus Climate Data Store (CDS) to search for Marine, Coastal and Fisheries data and perform some analyses and processing relevant to the user community.  
The notebooks are available to run on the Jupyter Notebook server (https://rsg-dias.eofrom.space).
